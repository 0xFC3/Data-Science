# Mnist-Tensorflow
This is my submission to the kaggle mnist data set.
I wrote this program with google colaboratory. THis is the reason why some lines of the code will not be executable now, because they are not written in Python. You can execute and look at the project by this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oFjUI9vEcJQS5cQiRAIzJ5e2nyhmfXq9
